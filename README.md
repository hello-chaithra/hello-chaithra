⚔️ An aspiring software engineer on a quest to master the fundamentals of computer science & engineering.

⏪👀 Previously on my GitHub:
- **Nand2Tetris Part I: Hardware** (Projects 1-6) 
  Built elementary logic gates → ALU → full 16-bit Hack computer hardware in HDL.  
  (In progress – watch this space!)

- **Nand2Tetris Part II: Software** (Projects 7-12)  
  Assembler → VM Translator → Compiler → OS. Turned bits into a modern software stack!  
  (In progress – watch this space!)

👀⏩ Coming Next: FPGA Implementation of Nand2Tetris
Taking the Hack computer from simulation to real hardware on an FPGA board. Synthesis, timing, blinking LEDs incoming!  


## 🛠️ Tools & Artifacts in My Inventory

- **Languages**: HDL (Hack), Assembly, Jack, Python, C/C++ (and growing!)
- **Currently Grinding**: Verilog/VHDL, FPGA tooling (Vivado/Quartus), low-level systems
- **Side Quests**: Algorithms, data structures, operating systems concepts
